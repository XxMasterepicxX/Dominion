- Relationship linking working perfectly
- No critical bugs

---

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

### 1. Run Production qPublic Enrichment ⚡ **TOP PRIORITY**

**Why:** 108k properties currently have basic data from CAMA, but missing:
- Precise coordinates (lat/lon)
- Sales history (14+ years)
- Permit history from qPublic
- Building details
- TRIM notices

**Action:**
```bash
# Test batch first (5k properties, ~1.5 hours)
python scripts/qpublic_bulk_enrichment.py --market gainesville_fl --limit 5000

# Monitor success rate
# If 95%+ success, run full batch

# Full enrichment (108k properties, ~32 hours)
python scripts/qpublic_bulk_enrichment.py --market gainesville_fl --batch-size 1000 --parallel 10
```

**Timeline:**
- Test run: 1.5 hours
- Full run: 1.3 days (can run overnight/weekend)

**Result:**
- 100% property data completeness
- Enable spatial queries (coordinates)
- Enable deal analysis (sales history)

---

### 2. Set Up Daily Scraper Cron Jobs 📅

**Why:** Daily automated data collection for fresh permits, news, LLCs

**Action:**
```bash
# Create cron jobs for:

# 6 AM: City permits (daily)
0 6 * * * cd /path/to/dominion && python -m src.scrapers.permits.city_permits --market gainesville_fl --days 1

# 6:30 AM: County permits (daily)
30 6 * * * cd /path/to/dominion && python -m src.scrapers.permits.county_permits --market gainesville_fl --days 1

# 7 AM: Sunbiz NEW LLCs (daily)
0 7 * * * cd /path/to/dominion && python -m src.scrapers.data_sources.sunbiz --market gainesville_fl --days 1

# 8 AM: Crime data (daily)
0 8 * * * cd /path/to/dominion && python -m src.scrapers.data_sources.crime_data --market gainesville_fl --days 1

# Every 4 hours: News scraping
0 */4 * * * cd /path/to/dominion && python -m src.scrapers.business.news_rss --market gainesville_fl
```

**Timeline:** 1-2 hours to configure

**Result:** Automated daily data collection

---

### 3. Add Monitoring & Alerts 📊

**Why:** Know when scrapers fail or data quality drops

**Action:**
Create simple monitoring:
```python
# src/monitoring/health_check.py

# Email/Slack alerts when:
# - Scraper fails 2 days in a row
# - < 5 permits found (unusually low)
# - Database connection fails
# - qPublic enrichment < 90% success
```

**Timeline:** 2-3 hours

**Result:** Proactive issue detection

---

## 🔜 Next 2 Weeks (Phase 3 Completion)

### Week 1:
- ✅ qPublic bulk enrichment complete
- ✅ Daily scrapers running
- ✅ Monitoring in place

### Week 2:
- Build opportunity detection queries:
  - Assemblage patterns (same owner, adjacent properties)
  - Distressed properties (bank-owned, estates)
  - Flips (sold + permits within 6 months)
- Test with real data
- Document findings

**Deliverable:** First intelligence insights from data

---

## 🎯 Next Month (Phase 4 Start)

### Option A: Build Web Dashboard
**Goal:** Visualize data and opportunities

**Features:**
- Property search (address, parcel, owner)
- Map view (coordinates from qPublic)
- Permit timeline
- Entity portfolio view
- Opportunity alerts

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks
**Tech:** FastAPI + HTMX + TailwindCSS

---

### Option B: Add Second Market
**Goal:** Test multi-market architecture

**Action:**
```sql
-- Add Tampa market (takes 5 minutes)
INSERT INTO markets VALUES (..., 'tampa_fl', 'Tampa, FL', ...);
CREATE TABLE properties_tampa_fl PARTITION OF properties FOR VALUES IN (tampa_id);
-- ... create other partitions

-- Run Tampa scrapers
python -m src.scrapers.permits.city_permits --market tampa_fl --days 30
python scripts/bulk_data_sync.py --market tampa_fl
```

**Timeline:** 1 week (setup + data collection)
**Result:** Prove multi-market architecture works

---

### Option C: ML-Based Entity Resolution
**Goal:** Implement DATABASE_ARCHITECTURE_FINAL.md

**Requirements:**
- Label 2,000 entity match examples (true/false matches)
- Train calibrated confidence models
- Implement three-band thresholding
- Add release gates

**Timeline:** 4 weeks (per DATABASE_ARCHITECTURE_FINAL.md)
**Result:** 99% precision entity matching

---

## 🤔 Decision Point: What Should You Build Next?

After Phase 3 completion, pick ONE:

**A. Dashboard** → If you want to show/sell the product
**B. Second Market** → If you want to prove scalability
**C. ML Entity Resolution** → If you want production-quality data

**My Recommendation:**
1. **This week:** qPublic + daily scrapers (Phase 3)
2. **Next week:** Opportunity detection queries
3. **Month 2:** Build dashboard (Option A) to showcase insights

**Why Dashboard First:**
- Visual proof of value
- Easy to demo to potential customers
- Can charge $200/analysis immediately
- Dashboard informs what ML features matter most

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

**Phase 3 Success (This Month):**
- ✅ 108k properties enriched with qPublic data (100% complete)
- ✅ Daily scrapers running (100% automated)
- ✅ 0 scraper failures for 7 consecutive days
- ✅ 5+ opportunity patterns detected (assemblages, flips, etc.)

**Phase 4 Success (Next Month):**
- Option A: Dashboard deployed with 3+ key features
- Option B: Tampa market operational with 20k+ properties
- Option C: Entity resolution 95%+ precision on validation set

---

## 🚨 Known Issues / Tech Debt

**Minor (Non-blocking):**
1. qPublic requires visible browsers (can't run headless)
   - Run on desktop machine, not headless server
2. No SQL migrations system
   - Manual SQL for now, add Alembic later if needed
3. Enrichment is synchronous (no background queue)
   - Fast enough for now (4 min for 100 LLCs)

**Future Enhancements (DATABASE_ARCHITECTURE_FINAL.md):**
- ML-based confidence scoring
- Apache AGE for graph queries (if needed)
- pgvectorscale for semantic search
- Provenance algebra (if needed)

---

## 📞 Questions to Answer

Before starting Phase 4, decide:

1. **Business Goal:** Sell product OR build portfolio?
   - Sell → Build dashboard + charge $200/analysis
   - Portfolio → Focus on opportunity detection + deal execution

2. **Market Strategy:** Single-market depth OR multi-market breadth?
   - Depth → Perfect Gainesville, find every opportunity
   - Breadth → Add Tampa/Orlando, prove scalability

3. **Quality Bar:** Ship fast OR production-perfect?
   - Fast → Use current entity resolution (85% threshold)
   - Perfect → Implement ML scoring (99% precision, requires labeling)

**Your choice determines next 3 months of work.**
