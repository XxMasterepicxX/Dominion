# Dominion Project Phases - Unified Mapping

**Last Updated:** January 5, 2025
**Purpose:** Map all documentation phases to canonical phase system

---

## Canonical Phase System (from PROJECT_STATUS.md)

### ‚úÖ Phase 0: Analysis & Planning (Oct 2-3, 2025)
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Work:**
- Database analysis and rebuild decision
- Multi-market architecture design
- Schema v2 planning

**Docs:**
- `RESET_AND_REBUILD_PLAN.md`
- `DOMINION_DATABASE_FINAL_DESIGN.md`

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Database Rebuild (Oct 3-5, 2025)
**Status:** COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Work:**
- Nuked old database
- Created schema_v2_multimarket.sql
- Re-imported CAMA bulk data (108k properties)
- Fixed critical CAMA address field mapping bug
- E2E testing (99.56% address coverage, 99%+ relationship linking)

**Deliverables:**
- Multi-market partitioned database
- 108k properties loaded
- 770+ permits with relationships
- 870+ entity records

**Docs:**
- `MULTI_MARKET_DATABASE_DESIGN.md` (current reality)
- `CAMA_ADDRESS_FIX_TEST_RESULTS.md`
- `COMPREHENSIVE_E2E_TEST_FINAL_RESULTS.md`

**Mapping to other docs:**
- `WHATS_NEXT_ROADMAP.md` Phase 1 (Week 1) ‚úÖ
- `dominion_mvp_implementation_plan.md` Week 1 ‚úÖ

---

### üîÑ Phase 2: qPublic Enrichment Optimization (Oct 5, 2025)
**Status:** TESTED, READY TO RUN AT SCALE

**Work:**
- Tested parallel scraping approaches
- Fixed timeout issues (8s ‚Üí 30s, removed networkidle waits)
- Added reCAPTCHA v3 bypass
- **RESULT:** 10 separate browsers = 100% success, 1.34 days for 108k properties

**Next Step:**
- Run production qPublic enrichment (5k-10k properties first)

**Docs:**
- `PARALLEL_SCRAPING_TEST_RESULTS.md`
- PROJECT_STATUS.md "Phase 2: qPublic Enrichment"

**Mapping to other docs:**
- `WHATS_NEXT_ROADMAP.md` Phase 3 (Week 3)
- `dominion_mvp_implementation_plan.md` NOT PLANNED (new work)

---

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Phase 3: Production Deployment (NOT STARTED)
**Status:** PENDING

**Work Needed:**
- Set up daily scraper cron jobs
- Add error notifications (email/Slack)
- Implement monitoring (scraper_runs table)
- Run qPublic bulk enrichment (108k properties)

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

**Docs:**
- `WHATS_NEXT_ROADMAP.md` Phase 2 (Week 2)
- `dominion_mvp_implementation_plan.md` Weeks 2-4

---

### üîÆ Phase 4: Advanced Features (FUTURE)
**Status:** NOT STARTED

**Work:**
- Opportunity detection (assemblage, distressed properties)
- ML & AI features (entity resolution improvements)
- API & Frontend dashboard
- Cross-market expansion (Tampa, Orlando)

**Timeline:** Months 2-6

**Docs:**
- `WHATS_NEXT_ROADMAP.md` Phases 4-10
- `DATABASE_ARCHITECTURE_FINAL.md` (ML improvements)
- `dominion_engineering_plan_v2.md` (full vision)

---

## Document Purposes Clarified

### Current Reality (What Exists)
- ‚úÖ `MULTI_MARKET_DATABASE_DESIGN.md` - Database schema v2 (implemented)
- ‚úÖ `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Current status and achievements
- ‚úÖ `SYSTEM_AUDIT_REPORT.md` - Testing validation results
- ‚úÖ `FILE_STRUCTURE.md` - Project organization

### Future Plans (What's Planned)
- üìã `MULTI_MARKET_DATABASE_DESIGN.md` Section 11 - ML-based enhancements (needs 2k labeled examples)
- üìã `WHATS_NEXT_ROADMAP.md` - Phases 2-10 roadmap
- üìã `dominion_engineering_plan_v2.md` - Complete business + technical vision

### Guides & Setup
- üìñ `BULK_DATA_SETUP.md` - How to set up bulk data sync
- üìñ `dominion_mvp_implementation_plan.md` - Original MVP plan (mostly complete)

---

## What's Next? (Current Focus)

Based on canonical phases, you are currently at:

**‚úÖ Phase 1 Complete:** Database rebuild, CAMA import, E2E testing
**üîÑ Phase 2 In Progress:** qPublic parallel testing complete, ready for production run
**‚è≠Ô∏è Phase 3 Next:** Daily scrapers + qPublic bulk enrichment

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Run qPublic enrichment batch (5k-10k properties) ‚Üê **DO THIS FIRST**
2. Set up daily scraper cron jobs
3. Complete full 108k qPublic enrichment (1-2 days runtime)
