# Simplified Lambda Layer Dependencies for Hackathon
# Only what we actually use in the handlers

# AWS SDK (already provided by Lambda runtime, but good to pin version)
boto3>=1.34.144
botocore>=1.34.144

# That's it! Our handlers are self-contained and use only:
# - boto3 (AWS services)
# - json (Python stdlib)
# - typing (Python stdlib)
# - datetime (Python stdlib)

# NOTE: After hackathon, when scrapers are deployed, add:
# patchright>=1.0.0
# beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0
# requests>=2.31.0
